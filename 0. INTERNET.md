It is that fancy world where you open a browser, type something, Google comes back with an answer. Thanks to the European Union that is no more the case, so you might have Duck Duck Go.
Well, forget about that, we will skip how your typing becomes a search and focus instead on the old ways when you had to type www. something ... or even http:// something... ok? no, too bad.

(just so u know, if u end an fqdn with /, the browser will not interpret it as a search)
An fqdn is a Fully Qualified Domain Name. What's a domain? www.whatever.com for instance. 
Or something like i.dont.wanna.fall.asleep.eu is also a valid domain. It translates to an IP address and magic happens (that I'll dive later, in a separete file) and you get back your site.
 > TBH (to be honest) ...this is internet Jargon, you get a better description on Wikipedia.

On the internet, almost everything is served by a reverse proxy, therefore http/https traffic.
You make a request, someone answer. How do you make a request? curl is your friend. You could just open a browser and do the same thing, but where will it be the fun? We wanna look under the hood. (I'll get back to the browser later on for more advanced deep diving, maybe)

So, if you are on linux... that's given... open a Terminal, type `curl www.example.com`
OsX, goes as said, Windows... shall work too. In case, you need to install it.

I love the internet, of course someone has registered www.example.com and is ok with people using it for this kind of books... or any purpose, as it says in the HTML being displayed.

It will spit out HTML: I don't care, at this stage, about it. Therefore, just forward it to a place where it will not bother us. `curl www.example.com > /dev/null`

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  1256  100  1256    0     0   5596      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  5607
```
Those above are just stats. Not relevant as well, for now. Please bare with me. 
If you are concerned about using a terminal, please search any `bash guide` online. 

So, we asked something, we got a reply. But how? What happened? Let's raise the volume. `-v`
Dash-v stands for "verbose", this and all other flags of `curl` are available just by typing curl alone or with `--help` or `man curl` as most of *nix/Linux command line programs.

```
% curl -v www.example.com >/dev/null
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

Ok, we got even an IPv6 address, this was not intended. Please ignore it for now, not in the scope of this guide. Just focus on the fact that something happened, we got an Internet Address (one IPv4 one IPv6, the latter was used in this case, and as it says, it `connected` to something). We are slowly getting more and more concept introduced, all at once, I know. A bit too much, please open a ticket or a pull request to this report if you wanna contribute, ok?

We connected to an IP and a Port. Yes, everything, not something, everything on the internet is addressed by an IP Address a Port. It is as if your house had an address and one or several ports to get in. Simple concept, no? Well, ports are a single integer number from 0 to 65635.
(why the number? if you wanna go this deep, look for the book "TCP/IP Illustrated, Stevens")

Just for myself, to see if I got the number right, fire up `calc`, another fancy utility:
```
; 2^16
	65536
```

Once again, too deep... but before splitting to a separate file just for `curl`, I wanna highlight the important information we sent out... OUT... `>` curl is marking what it is sending with that... and `<` receving, come IN. Pretty clear? Look at the output above.

```
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
```
This is all we care about. Even, `Host: whatever` could be omitted to. All we need to talk to a reverse proxy (or server) over the internet, using the http protocol is `GET /`, for now.

And, we need to talk to port 80, unless we wanna deal with SSL (encryption introduced initially to support e-commerce, but that became required to run reasonably any internet exposed site).

I wanted to make an example without curl talking to www.example.com without HTTP 1.1 but, it did not answer... have a try to `telnet www.google.com 80` and type `GET /`, you get back html "again". 

Now move on to chapter 1 related to HTTP 1.1... and why...

I started working professionally when I was 16, therefore what I'm going to explain here I saw evolving naturally. Basically it was the time it was the few of us, over on the internet, with our noisy slow dial-up modems and our public IPv4 IP addresses. It was easy to put the picture of a cat on the internet. 

Once connected you just had to install Apache, mod the `/var/www/root` with a couple of lines of HTML and a picture of a cat, and voila! You had a website... a no-one to look at it. 

To reach the site... http://123.123.123.123/ in the browser, or whatever was the IP we had, and we had it... there were tricks also to associate a name to it, but again, enough of amarcord.

I could also tell a friend to `telnet 123.123.123.123 80` and to do `GET /` and he
she/they'd get back an answer, not the image though, just the HTML. For gettting the image, they'd had to parse the HTML, see the address of the image, get that too and decode it.

Well, where I wanna bring you? This is HTTP 1.0, therefore there was no need of telling otherwise. But with such information you could only host one website. The default you had.
Since, even if you'd put `telnet www.example.com 80`, the hostname information would be available only to you, as you translate it to an IP and connect to it. The server would not know what was you were looking for, it will assume it has to answer only to `GET /` and provide whatever is available. So, how do they get more sites on the internet? One IP address for each site? Yeah, well, not really feasible. So, you had to tell what you wanted. How?

First of all you have to tell your intentions, and to not break compatibility, before the new line character (or hitting enter) from your side, at the end of `GET /` they appended an extra information `HTTP/1.1`. Therefore, please wait, we have more to ask. 

`Host: whatever` ...Host is the "header" that allows us to tell the server what we want from it.
I attempted again with www.example.com... it wants an extra return at the end of the talk:

```
% telnet www.example.com 80
Trying 2606:2800:21f:cb07:6820:80da:af6b:8b2c...
Connected to www.example.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.1

```
See the empty line, and the answer that follows...
ctrl+c to quit it, as it seems it keeps the socket open.

Argh, more concepts? What's a socket? It's what's transporting our typing back and forth.

Please continue on chapter 2... I wanna dive the PATH

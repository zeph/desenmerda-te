(I can already see the owners of that site writing me to complain of choosing em as example)
Anyhow, why? What happened? What's Apache Benchmark? If you have a Mac (Apple/OsX) it is there by default. `ab` for the friends. It is a tool to do lots of requests at once. Here we fired ONE. xD

I was tempted to type `ab www.example.com` but I got the help command output back to me.
It wants explicitly the protocol (http or https) you wanna talk to the server and the PATH /

Same command on the resource from Wikipedia:

Port Path & Hostname, as u can see, it comes down to this... and you got a Non-2xx answer. 
Well, yeah, the 308. Oh, the HTTP RESPONSE CODES... Look, search for it. 200 is OK, anything else... meh. 300s are usually "go somewhere else" in different nuances, 400 "not here/denied". 500 "something went bad on my side". Anything above that, you are doing something very odd.

Let's fire 10 req. at the same time!  `-c 10`, ah right... it wants also a count of requests `-n 10` for now... so, out of a bucket of 10 apples, each of the 10 people will get one. Right?

```

Fancy, `ab` gives us as well the percentiles. All good, the numbers are very low so, Wikimedia Foundation has not even notices us so far... and we are getting all redirects, so no downloads, the bandwidth usage is minimal. But if you hit the right address on https//, that's different.

 We start to get to know info about the cryptography used
```
SSL/TLS Protocol:       TLSv1.2,ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305,256,256
Server Temp Key:        ECDH X25519 253 bits
```

The data exchanged starts to be "not neglectable" -> couple of MBs
`Total transferred:      171780 bytes`

And we start getting proper data about stats.

But answer are fast, really fast, why?

Go to the next chapter on 5. static-vs-dynamic content.
